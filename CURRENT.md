## In Progress

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0007](tasks/AR-0007.md): Upgrade engine and rollback | Execute upgrades atomically and restore the known-good runtime on every failure path. | Finish meaningful branch coverage for upgrade_engine/control_store to >=95% without exclusions; then close production authority/runtime reread and sidecar binding gaps before formal review. | codex-awc-ar0007-upgrade-engine-20260914 |

## Blocked

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0011](tasks/AR-0011.md): Bounded TLA+ execution and admission safety | Prevent unbounded coordinator TLA+ jobs from exhausting shared host memory. | Monitor exact-head run 34783911645 for 59a49ef; verify runner-bus setup passes before required full formal gate. Do not merge until fresh review and all checks pass. | - |

## Planned

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0008](tasks/AR-0008.md): Formal upgrade and recovery model | Formally verify upgrade safety, crash recovery, rollback, and functional reopen conditions. | Model upgrade and rollback invariants and bind them to exhaustive bounded implementation tests. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0009](tasks/AR-0009.md): Release integration and first upgrade | Publish and exercise generated upgrade paths for every release without sacrificing recoverability. | Add release CI generation, publication evidence, and the first independently reviewed upgrade campaign. | - |
| P1 | [AR-0010](tasks/AR-0010.md): Operational upgrade runbooks and generated release steps | Make every release's prerequisites, steps, evidence, and rollback path explicit and safe to operate. | Generate release-specific operator and agent upgrade/rollback runbooks and privacy-test them. | - |

## Done

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0001](tasks/AR-0001.md): Integrate AWQ v0.32.0 into the coordinator | Adopt AWQ v0.32.0 while retaining coordinator-native quality and formal gates. | Merged PR #20 at merge commit 713761b; post-merge AWQ PR check passes; no coordinator release was published by this merge. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0002](tasks/AR-0002.md): Correctness-first coordinator upgrade protocol | Define a correctness-first coordinator release upgrade with verified backup and rollback. | Merged PR #21 at bd070596729949a77cfb4fae7c4230055f3f4ece. Post-merge AWQ and focused contract verification pass; no coordinator release published. AR-0011 remains the next open child. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0003](tasks/AR-0003.md): Release-upgrade contract and generator | Generate and validate complete, bounded upgrade instructions for every release. | PR #23 at 736d2e2 is published; await exact-head verify run 34784319165 and independent review before merge. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0004](tasks/AR-0004.md): Quiescence and upgrade preflight | Prevent upgrades from starting unless the coordination system can remain safe and functional. | AR-0004 complete; PR #24 merged and post-merge main verification green. AR-0007 is now dependency-ready for phase-machine implementation. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0005](tasks/AR-0005.md): Git-backend backup and restore | Back up and restore complete Git-backed coordination state without losing task history. | AR-0005 complete; PR #25 merged and post-merge main verification green. AR-0006 PR #26 remains open pending independent review and exact-head checks. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0006](tasks/AR-0006.md): SQLite backup, migration, and restore | Preserve SQLite authority and recoverability through coordinator upgrades and migrations. | AR-0006 complete; PR #26 merged and post-merge main verification green. AR-0004 remains blocked pending its correctness fixes and healthy exact-head rerun. | - |
