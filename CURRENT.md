## In Progress

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0007](tasks/AR-0007.md): Upgrade engine and rollback | PR #81 merged as 05ebaee from signed a8ef7ef. Post-merge Verify 34884165286 passed with 405 tests, coverage gate, and formal tier. The supersession coverage regression is repaired; production mutation and dispatch remain disabled. | Implement the next bounded control/journal CAS-release or ambiguous-recovery slice from exact main 05ebaee in a fresh worktree; publish only after full tests and independent exact-head review. | codex-awc-ar0007-next-20260914 |
| P0 | [AR-0008](tasks/AR-0008.md): Formal upgrade and recovery model | PR #81 exact-head a8ef7ef against combined main 5b38583 is test-only supersession-validation coverage repair: one test method adds malformed successor, self-reference, and cyclic-chain fail-closed cases in tests/test_handoffctl.py. No production, formal, model, mutation, or gate logic changed. PR body reports 405 tests and coverage >=95 locally; GitHub Verify 34884022446 has awq SUCCESS, scope SUCCESS, smoke SUCCESS, but verify SKIPPED by path scope, so the coverage claim is not independently confirmed by required CI on this test-only PR. Exact-head unittest discovery was launched in an isolated worktree; no formal/TLC claim is made. | Recommend merge only as narrowly scoped test coverage after independent checks remain clean; require the next combined-main Verify to execute and pass the 95% coverage gate and formal tier. Preserve implementation_refinement=not-proven and mutation disabled; no model/TLC changes. | codex-awc-ar0008-next-20260914 |

## Open

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0014](tasks/AR-0014-verified-supersession-dependencies.md): Verified supersession dependency readiness | Make explicitly verified superseded tasks satisfy dependencies only through a completed successor. | Publish a signed immutable coordinator release containing the merged supersession implementation after release-specific provenance checks; then perform downstream vendor synchronization through AR-1182. Ignore unrelated coordinator coverage work. | - |

## Planned

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0009](tasks/AR-0009.md): Release integration and first upgrade | Publish and exercise generated upgrade paths for every release without sacrificing recoverability. | Add release CI generation, publication evidence, and the first independently reviewed upgrade campaign. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0012](tasks/AR-0012.md): Durable upgrade barrier and SQLite write fencing | Durably fence upgrade admission and every SQLite authority mutation under one project barrier. | Promote only after AR-0007 is complete; then implement the accepted barrier, fencing, and fail-closed SQLite contract with exact-head tests and formal refinement evidence. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0013](tasks/AR-0013.md): Selector-aware authenticated versioned runtime | Bind an authenticated, selector-aware versioned coordinator runtime to safe upgrade and rollback execution. | Design and implement the stable bootstrap, authenticated versioned runtime store, selector publication, and validation-to-exec binding only after AR-0007 and AR-0008 provide accepted executable contracts. | - |
| P1 | [AR-0010](tasks/AR-0010.md): Operational upgrade runbooks and generated release steps | Make every release's prerequisites, steps, evidence, and rollback path explicit and safe to operate. | Generate release-specific operator and agent upgrade/rollback runbooks and privacy-test them. | - |

## Done

| Priority | Task | Summary | Next action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | [AR-0001](tasks/AR-0001.md): Integrate AWQ v0.32.0 into the coordinator | Adopt AWQ v0.32.0 while retaining coordinator-native quality and formal gates. | Merged PR #20 at merge commit 713761b; post-merge AWQ PR check passes; no coordinator release was published by this merge. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0002](tasks/AR-0002.md): Correctness-first coordinator upgrade protocol | Define a correctness-first coordinator release upgrade with verified backup and rollback. | Merged PR #21 at bd070596729949a77cfb4fae7c4230055f3f4ece. Post-merge AWQ and focused contract verification pass; no coordinator release published. AR-0011 remains the next open child. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0003](tasks/AR-0003.md): Release-upgrade contract and generator | Generate and validate complete, bounded upgrade instructions for every release. | PR #23 at 736d2e2 is published; await exact-head verify run 34784319165 and independent review before merge. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0004](tasks/AR-0004.md): Quiescence and upgrade preflight | Prevent upgrades from starting unless the coordination system can remain safe and functional. | AR-0004 complete; PR #24 merged and post-merge main verification green. AR-0007 is now dependency-ready for phase-machine implementation. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0005](tasks/AR-0005.md): Git-backend backup and restore | Back up and restore complete Git-backed coordination state without losing task history. | AR-0005 complete; PR #25 merged and post-merge main verification green. AR-0006 PR #26 remains open pending independent review and exact-head checks. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0006](tasks/AR-0006.md): SQLite backup, migration, and restore | Preserve SQLite authority and recoverability through coordinator upgrades and migrations. | AR-0006 complete; PR #26 merged and post-merge main verification green. AR-0004 remains blocked pending its correctness fixes and healthy exact-head rerun. | - |
| P0 | [AR-0011](tasks/AR-0011.md): Bounded TLA+ execution and admission safety | Exact-head PR #22 formal publication gate independently reviewed green. | Await parent merge decision; retain full-exhaustive claims for successful scheduled/manual run and preserve merge-tree attestation provenance. | - |
